**Description**:- 
The main idea of our project is to utilize the parking space beacause urbanization continues to accelerate, parking congestion has become a pressing issue in many cities worldwide. In response, we have devloped a model that can tackle the all the problem  like this. It is very specific for those places where boundary of parking(L-type structure) is not mentioned for vehicles. It is based on video(capturing) and might be use as live camera detector.

**Applications**:- 
1. Classification of individual parking spaces.
2. Automatic detection of parking spaces positions.
3. Vehicles counting or detection.
