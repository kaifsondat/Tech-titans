**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to address the challenges associated with parking congestion and inefficient space utilization in urban parking lots. By leveraging computer vision algorithms, the system aims to accurately detect and track vehicles in parking spaces, provide real-time occupancy information, and optimize parking allocation to enhance urban mobility and improve the overall parking experience.

**Features:**

Vehicle Detection: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect vehicles entering and exiting parking spaces.
Real-time Occupancy Monitoring: Provides real-time information on parking space occupancy and availability.
Parking Guidance System: Guides drivers to available parking spots using dynamic signage or mobile applications.
Data Analytics: Analyzes parking occupancy data to identify usage patterns, peak hours, and demand trends.
Automated Enforcement: Integrates license plate recognition technology for automated parking enforcement and compliance monitoring.

**Installation:**

Clone the project repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/kaifsondat/Tech-titans.git
Install required dependencies: py -m pip install opencv-python
Configure the system parameters and camera settings in the configuration file.
Run the main application script: python main.py

**Usage:**

Start the application to initialize the parking management system.
Monitor the dashboard or mobile application for real-time parking occupancy information.
Use the parking guidance system to navigate to available parking spaces.
Analyze parking occupancy data and generate reports for further analysis and decision-making.
Monitor compliance with parking regulations using automated enforcement features.

**Future Enhancements:**

Integration with IoT devices for seamless data exchange and communication.
Development of predictive analytics models to forecast parking demand and optimize resource allocation.
Integration with smart city initiatives and public transportation systems for holistic urban mobility solutions.
Implementation of machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance of parking infrastructure.
Expansion of the system to support multi-level parking structures and outdoor parking lots.

**Conclusion:**
The Computer Vision-Based Car Parking Lot Management project offers a comprehensive solution for addressing parking congestion and optimizing space utilization in urban parking lots. By leveraging computer vision technology, real-time data analytics, and automated enforcement features, the system aims to improve urban mobility, enhance user experience, and promote sustainable transportation practices. Through ongoing development and collaboration, the project strives to create smarter, more efficient, and accessible parking solutions for urban environments.
